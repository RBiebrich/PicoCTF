# Inspect HTML

> Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.

From the title alone, our approach here should be pretty straight forward. We open the linked webpage which displays to us some experpt from Wikepedia on the Greek ruler Histiaeus. This information appears to be of no use to us. We open dev tools and immediately head to the **Inspect** tab to examine the HTML, as the title of the challenge seems to explicitly suggest.

Lo and behold...

We found the flag!
